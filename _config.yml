  PFPSim is a host-compiled simulation framework for early validation and analysis of packet processing applications on programmable forwarding plane architectures. Simulation models are automatically generated from a high-level description of the hardware/software architecture of the forwarding device, written in FAD, and the behavioural description of the various modules in the architecture, written in C++/SystemC. Our FAD language is capable of defining many-core network processors as well as reconfigurable pipelines.
  Application developers can use PFPSim as a virtual prototype to simulate and debug their applications before hardware availability. Hardware architects can use PFPSim to evaluate the trade-offs between different hardware/software design decisions.
